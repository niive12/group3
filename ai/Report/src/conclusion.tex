\section{Conclusion}
A solver was made that was able to find a solution of the competition map in 0.386 seconds, creating 33160 nodes.
This was done using a breadth first graph search algorithm. 
It was shown that the solver can solve a number of different tasks, using a set of maps called microban. 
The solver can also find the optimal solution in relation to robot moves where the time it would take to complete the map is estimated to 2 minutes, 48 seconds.
The robot that should execute the solution was build, however it was flawed, and could therefore not finish running the map during the competition.
The flaws of the robot was mainly in the design of the robot, and would therefore be possible to optimize.
