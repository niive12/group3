\section{Conclusion}
A solver was made that was able to find a solution of the competition map in

seconds. This was done using a breadth first graph search algorithm. 
It was shown that the solver can solve a number of different tasks, using a set of maps called microban. 
The robot that should execute the solution was build, however it was flawed, and could therefore not finish running the map during the competition.
The flaws of the robot was mainly design wise, and would therefore not be difficult to optimize.
