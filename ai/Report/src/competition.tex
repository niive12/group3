\section{Competition}
The task that was given was to solve the sokoban puzzle on a map put in the foyer of the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller building on SDU, as fast as possible.
The entire course was given the same task, and the group with the fastest time won a prize.
The map is composed of lines, and intersections, where the intersections are to be considered as spaces in the sokoban map. 
A representation of the map can be seen in figure \ref{fig:comp_map}.
One of the things to note is that the foyer has glass walls and the competition is at noon, which means that the sun can play a role.
