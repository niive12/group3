\section{Competition}
The task was to solve a Sokoban puzzle on a printed out map put in the foyer of the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller building on SDU, as fast as possible.
The map is composed of lines, and intersections, where the intersections are to be considered as spaces in the Sokoban map. 
A representation of the map can be seen in figure \ref{fig:comp_map}.
An important thing to note is the foyer has glass walls which means the sunlight might effect the sensors.
