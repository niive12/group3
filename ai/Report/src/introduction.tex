\section{Introduction}

This project is a description on how to make a robot that can solve the puzzle game sokoban. 
The robot is made in Lego, using a Lego Mindstorm kit, and the solution generating code is written in C++. 
The robot is supposed to execute the solution on a map, pushing cans around. 
The report is split up into three parts, one describing the robot and one describing the solver program and in the end a section discussing what when good, what went bad and what could be improved.
