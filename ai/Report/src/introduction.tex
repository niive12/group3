\section{Introduction}

% This project is a description on how to make a robot that can solve the puzzle game Sokoban.

The game of Sokoban is a simple puzzle.
The original game is to control a warehouse keeper who pushes boxes into the right locations.
The player is allowed to move up, down, left and right and to push a box in a direction that is not obstructed by a wall or another box.
Variations of this game have changed the warehouse boxes to diamonds, but the problem remains unchanged.
The variation for this project is pushing cans of tomato paste.
In this paper, objects will be referred to as diamonds.

Sokoban is interesting because it is a NP-hard problem, so making a solver that is good is quite a challenge, however the rules of the game are simple.
With a concise description of the world, every possible situation can be simulated until a goal condition is met.
But it is important to limit the scope of this search by knowing when to stop searching in one direction and when to favor another.

The robot is made in Lego, using a Lego Mindstorm kit, and the solution generating code is written in C++. 
The robot is supposed to execute the solution on a map , pushing cans around in the real world.
Constructing in Lego makes it possible to make quick prototypes and modifying the robot is easy.
