\section{Introduction}

This project is a description on how to make a robot that can solve the puzzle game Sokoban.

The game of Sokoban is a simple puzzle.
The original game is a warehouse keeper who pushes boxes into the right locations.
The player is allowed to move up, down, left and right and to push a box in a direction that is not obstructed by a wall or another box.
Variations of this game have changed the warehouse boxes to jewels, but the problem remains unchanged.
The variation for this project is pushing cans of tomato paste.

Sokoban is interesting, because it is a NP-hard problem, so making a solver that is good is quite a challenge, however the rules of the game are straight forward.
This means that focus can be put on solving the problem, rather than define move rules.

The robot is made in Lego, using a Lego Mindstorm kit, and the solution generating code is written in C++. 
The robot is supposed to execute the solution on a map , pushing cans around in the real world.
Prototyping in Lego is nice, due to reconfiguration of the robot being very easy.
