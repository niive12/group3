\section{Competition evaluation}
On the competition day the robot ran, however it did not finish the map.
The robot failed to turn enough at some points and the controller could not correct for it, and therefore the robot lost the line.

Going forward and turning worked fine in the tests, but putting everything together was not successful.
A thing that could help is to put the two line following sensors closer together.
This would lead to the robot detecting the line before, and the corrections would not be as big. 

Having an fourth sensor would also help, by making the turning better, however this was not possible.

The choice of wheels meant that the max speed of the robot is slower that using the biggest wheels available.
However it was assumed that changing construction was not needed and would take too much time.
In hindsight this was perhaps a bad idea.
