\section{Sokoban Solver}
The game of Sokoban is a simple puzzle.
The original game is a warehouse keeper who pushes boxes into the right locations.
The player is allowed to move up, down, left and right and to push a box in a direction that is not obstructed by a wall or another box.
Variations of this game have changed the warehouse boxes to jewels, but the problem remains unchanged.
The variation for this project is pushing cans of tomato paste.

The notation for the map uses J for jewels, M for the man, X for walls and G for goals.
To visualize the maps and the solutions, the maps is put into an existing application \cite{url:qml-sokoban} is used.
In figure \ref{fig:sokoban_map_2015_img} is the sokoban map, which has been used in the competition, shown.

\subsection{Model of World}
The world of Sokoban consist of a map and a series of moves.
Each move is a node in a graph which consist of the position of the man and the position of the diamonds.
To reduce the search space, only states where the position of the diamonds is known to the solver.
Each node also contains the path length, so the solver can find the optimal solution, and a pointer to the parent node so a path is linked together.

The map consist of a representation of the map, with walls and static dead lock positions.
By having a representation of the map, finding the shortest path from the man to a diamond and detection of which diamonds is valid to push becomes possible.

The solver is made as an informed breadth first search.
The general algorithm can be seen in code section \ref{code:sokoban_solver}.

\begin{tikzpicture}
 \node[text width = 0.43\textwidth] at (0,0) {
 \begin{verbatim}
search_list.push(start)
while( !search_list.empty() ){
  N = search_list.pop()
  if( game_won ){
    print_path(N)
  } else if( !closed_set.exist(N) ){
    neighbors = valid_moves(N)
    if( !closed_set.exist(neighbors) ){
      search_list.push(neighbors)
    }
  }
}
 \end{verbatim}
 };
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Valid Moves}
A valid move is where a diamond has a reachable position from one direction and the other direction is either reachable or free space.
A breadth first search (wavefront) is used to this map to see all possible moves from the man's position.
Wavefront is an algorithm which takes the nearest valid moves and adds the move cost to the positions.
Consider all move directions as equal, the robot will add the cost of 1 to all neighboring fields.
In figure \ref{fig:wavefront} is the values from the wavefront shown.

\end{verbatim}
 \end{minipage}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Deadlock Detection}
If a diamond is pushed into a position so the map cannot be solved with any future moves the game is in a deadlock.
It is important to detect those situations to reduce the size of the graph.
There is several types of deadlocks in the game.

\begin{figure}

\begin{subfigure}{0.3\textwidth}

  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/deadlock_corner}

\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}{0.3\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/deadlock_diamond}
  \caption{Deadlock by other diamonds.}
  \label{fig:deadlock_diamond}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

If a diamond is pushed into a corner, the man is unable to pull it away.
In figure \ref{fig:deadlock_corner} is a diamond locked into a corner.
Another type of deadlock is when a diamond is at a wall from which it cannot escape as seen in figure \ref{fig:deadlock_wall}.

Walls and corners can be detected when the map is loaded as they are static places it would be bad to push the diamond into.
To find those, all corners are detected.
Then a path in every direction is explored. 
If this path leads to a clearing, the diamond can be pulled away.
If the path leads to a goal, the diamond can reach a goal state.
Directions which then can directly move from one corner to another is considered an inescapable wall.

Deadlocks which is created when diamonds is pushed into a cube, as seen in figure \ref{fig:deadlock_diamond} is not static places which can be avoided.
These has to be searched for at every diamond push so such situations can be avoided.

For simplicity, a diamond is not considered in a deadlock position if the diamond stands on a goal.
This leads to certain situations which cannot be detected.
Figure \ref{fig:deadlock_hard} is an example of such a situation.
Because the diamond is locked in a goal, the free space needed to push other goals in is removed and the map cannot be solved.
This situations are not detected.

Other types of deadlocks exist, but is mostly combinations of those so this is ignored.

\end{figure}

To test the strength of using deadlock detection, the sum of nodes in search list and closed list was compared.
Without any deadlock detection, the graph contained 217288 nodes.
With deadlock detection, the graph contained 33160 nodes when the solution was found.
This is a reduction of 86.76\%.
