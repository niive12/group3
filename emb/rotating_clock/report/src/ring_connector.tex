\section{Slip Ring Connector}\label{sec:ring_connector}
The board with the LEDs will be rotating, making the communication to this board a problem.
Existing solutions called slip rings exist, but the ones in the price range of this project is rated for 250 rpm, which will be too slow for this project.
So a custom solution will be devised to combat this.

To make communication between the rotating board and the stationary FPGA, a slip ring connector is made.
This was made as two Eagle components so the sizes are identical.
In figure \ref{fig:slip_ring_eagle} is the slip ring shown.
The bottom layer contains rings where the signal is sent to.
The top layer has pads directly over the rings and by having a wire that touches the ring, the connection can be made.
The outer layers are used for signals.
This allows for multiple wires to have contact with the ring.
The power supply is stabilized with a $220 \mu F$ capacitor.
This is done to stabilize the power signal and to make sure the LED drivers does not disconnect if the wire loses contact for a moment.
The duration of this disconnect is hard to determine, so the a large capacitor is chosen to maximize the lifespan in case of a disconnect.

The LED driver requires a signal for power, ground, input signal, a clock and a latch.
Having multiple drivers does not increase the number of wires.

\subsection{Testing}
Testing the communication is done by mounting the FPGA on the rotating board, using a battery as power supply, the FPGA will transmit the signal and receiving the signal on the base.
This is done to avoid having probes spinning around, damaging the probes.
The FPGA is placed as close to the center as possible in order minimize effecting the system.

The speed is controlled by regulating the voltage to find a maximum speed for each step of tested transmission frequencies.
A signal is considered stable if the waveform is distinct enough to carry the signal.
The minimum transfer frequency, $T_f$, is calculated in equation \ref{eq:min_clock_speed}.

\begin{equation}
  T_f = {RPS \cdot \text{Msg}_\text{length} \cdot Divisions }
 \label{eq:min_clock_speed}
\end{equation}

The minimum acceptable number of divisions is 60, one for each second.
The $\text{Msg}_\text{length}$ is set at 33, one for each LED and a latch signal.
This means the slip ring should deliver at least $59400 Hz$ signal when the motor is spinning at 30 RPS.
If this requirement is not met, the slip ring is not useable for the task.

Assumming linearity in the motor:

The board rotates at 15/36 the speed of the motor.
6v = 6000 rpm for motor = 2500 rpm for board = 41.67 rps
4.32 V = 30 RPS
