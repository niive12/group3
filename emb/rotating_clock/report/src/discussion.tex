Since SDU closed the SMD lab a lot of things were not possible to do.

In the beginning of the project it was decided that SMD components would be the best solution for some of the problems that were faced.
Using smaller, lighter components would not affect the stability as much as the bigger ones, as well as the aesthetic aspect would be better, since one could not see a big capacitor rotating around with the LEDs.
All of these choices were made before the SMD lab was closed.
It was suggested that the components could be soldered on by hand, however this was not in any way successful. 

A lot of the tests that should have been done
