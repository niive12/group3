\section{Implementation}
The clock is as mentioned implemented on an FPGA with code written in VHDL.
The code is split up into different modules to keep a high abstraction level, and introduce the possibility to reuse code for other projects.
An overview of how the modules are put together and how they communicate can be seen in figure \ref{fig::block_dia}.

The Encoder block is not a VHDL module.
It is to show the input of 3 wires, from the hall sensors.
