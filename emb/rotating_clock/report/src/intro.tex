\section{Introduction}
This project is about creating a watch, using a LED strip mounted on a pcb, that then rotates, creating the sense that the watch dial is fixed. 
Since changing images appears smooth after around 30 Hz \cite{article:rpm} the goal to get the pcb to rotate with at least 30 rps.

One of the biggest challenges of the project is to get a stationary FPGA to control a rotating board with LEDs.
A slip ring is made to deal with this problem.
