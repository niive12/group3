\section{Conclusion} 
Due to the lack of equipment available, the project was not finished.
The construction for the clock was made, and a slip ring for transferring data was designed.
None of this could be tested, so nothing can be said about the performance of the system.

The Hall effect sensor signals was digitized and debounced with a Schmitt trigger circuit and turned into a 3.3 V signal with a logic level converter.
The hardware design in VHDL was tested and it was found that the clock controller could successfully generate the data for the LED drivers.
The speed of the motor is controlled by a PI controller which will ensure the motor maintains a speed of 30 RPS.
The speed of the motor could not be tested without the finished system.

The housing and the shaft for the motor was designed and constructed with a 3D printer.
