\section{Introduction}
This project is about making a sorting device, that can detect the color of a brick and sort it using this knowledge. 
There are 2 parts of the project, designing a power supply and designing the actual sorter. 
The first part is solely a electronics task, but the sorter is a combination of VHDL and electronics. 

VHDL code, 
The C++ Code for communication, 
R code and scope data, used for evaluation,
and a video of the setup working is included in a zip file.
