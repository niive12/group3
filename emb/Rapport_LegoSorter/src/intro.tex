\section{Introduction}
This project is about making a sorting device, that can detect the color of a brick and sort it using this knowledge. There are 2 parts of the project, designing a power supply and designing the actual sorter. The first part is solely a electronics task, but the sorter is a combination of VHDL and electronics.
