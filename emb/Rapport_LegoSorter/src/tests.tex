\subsection{Current test of photo diode}
This test was done in order to dimension the resistor for the operational amplifier (op-amp), for the amplification.
The desired range of the output of the amplifier is 0 to 3.3 V to make it directly correlated with the ADC, which is powered by 3.3 V. 
\subsubsection{Setup}
The photo diode is put in a breadboard and the current through is measured using a multi meter. The different colored LED's are set up with a resistor so that they draw 50 mA of current which is the max DC-current\footnote{Ref to Application note}. The LED's and the photo diode are placed as they would on the final board, with a slight tilt towards the photo diode. A brick is then held over the diodes, and the current is read off the multimeter.

\subsubsection{Results}
The results of the test can be seen in table \ref{tab::test_pd}.

  & & \multicolumn{3}{c}{LED} \vline \\ 
  & & Red & Green & Blue \\
  \multirow{3}{*}{Brick}& Red & $16\ \mu A$ & $2\ \mu A$ & $5\ \mu A$ \\ 
  & Green & $5\ \mu A$ & $13\ \mu A$ & $9\ \mu A$ \\
  & Blue & $5\ \mu A$ & $6\ \mu A$ & $19\ \mu A$ \\

Dividing 1 V with 10 $\mu A$ in order to get the order of magnitude, gives 100 000. This leads to the value of the resistor should be 100 000 $\Omega$ 
\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Given the results of the test, and the fact that the current used here is lower than the one used in the project\footnote{Ref to section with LED circuit} it was decided that a value of 100 000 k$\Omega$ would be a reasonable. This gives 0.1 V pr $\mu A$.
