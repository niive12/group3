\section{Conclusion}

The power supply was designed with switching regulator and two linear regulators.
The photo diodes was amplified in unity gain circuit and meassured to be stable at 65 kHz.
An ADC was used to convert the voltage from the photo diode to a digital value, read by the FPGA.
The motor was controlled with a PWM signal, generated by the FPGA.
The bricks was successfully detected using a Nearest Neighbor classifier.
$\mu$TosNet was used to create a communication between a laptop and the FPGA.
The $\mu$TosNet communication allowed for a callibration of the classifiers.
A video demonstration can be found in the zip file.
