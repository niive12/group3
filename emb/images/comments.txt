#button debounce
    When a physical button is pressed, the contacts have an undefined period where there it will go back and forth between a connection and a brake. If this is viewed on an oscilloscope it will look like the signal is bouncing. 
    To debounce the signal a continuity check is performed. If the signal is consistent then the button status will be changed.
    This means that the button must be fully pressed for at least 4 ms.

#button states
To turn the button status into a pulse, a state machine is devised.
To detect single press a button must be pressed and released.
To expand the functionality, long press and double press was implemented.
Long press occurs when the button is not released within 500 ms and a timeout occurs.
Double press occurs when a button is pressed, released and pressed again within 150 ms.
